# Sign Lingo
#### A hand gesture &amp; Sign Language Detection Project, based on Computer Vision. Action Recognition using MediaPipe Holistic, OpenCV and an LSTM Deep Learning model.
Here, this model is trained manually for three actions: 
1. "Hello"
2. "Thanks"
3. "I Love You"

Trained on cpu, here are the following insights from tensorboard while training
